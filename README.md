# 507_final_project

This is an unfinished project. It belongs to a larger project that scrapes websites or collects data that is available for the analysis of long reads related to covid-19, including news articles, commentaries and non-fictional stories (no academic publications). 

After collecting the data, they will be put into a database using sqlite3 to allow users to enter a date and get back information about articles published on that day.
